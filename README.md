### Hi there ğŸ‘‹


ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating a similiarity algorithm and using Python to automate editing reports.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more Python, because there will always be something new to learn :) About to move onto my second coding language (R or Java).

ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ML/ AI projects. If you have any book recommendations, send my way!

ğŸ’¬ Ask me about tech and intergenerational differences.

âš¡ Fun fact: Born and raised in St. Thomas, and I speak 3 languages.
