### Hi there 👋
Welcome to my world of tech wizardry, where I'm always tinkering with code and exploring the latest breakthroughs in AI and machine learning!


🔭 I'm currently flexing my Python muscles by creating a similarity algorithm and automating report editing - two tasks that require a deep understanding of data structures and algorithms.

🌱 I’d love to learn about machine learning and AI so please send book recommendations!

💬 I'm fascinated by the intersection of technology and society, and I'm always exploring new ways to bridge the gap between generations.

⚡ Fun fact: I was born and raised in America's paradise. I now speak 3 languages (English, Spanish and Portuguese), and I've mastered the art of setting quarterly goals and sticking to routines like a pro!

📚 Currently Reading: Learning Python: Powerful Object-Oriented Programming by Mark Lutz, Proof of Stake by Vitalik Buterin, and Hamlet by Shakespeare (in Portuguese).

💡 In my free time, you can find me traveling to new countries, practicing yoga, or writing my book. In fact, I'm going on a solo writers retreat this summer.
