### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my world of tech wizardry, where I'm always tinkering with code and exploring the latest breakthroughs in AI and machine learning!

--
ðŸ”­ I'm currently flexing my Python muscles by creating a similarity algorithm and automating report editing - two tasks that require a deep understanding of data structures and algorithms.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™d love to learn about machine learning and AI so please send book recommendations!

ðŸ’¬ I'm fascinated by the intersection of technology and society, and I'm always exploring new ways to bridge the gap between generations.

âš¡ Fun fact: I was born and raised in America's paradise. I now speak 3 languages (English, Spanish and Portuguese), and I've mastered the art of setting quarterly goals and sticking to routines like a pro!

ðŸ“š Currently Reading: a book about Python, Proof of Stake by Vitalik Buterin, and Hamlet (in Portuguese)

ðŸ’¡ In my free time, you can find me traveling to new countries, learning languages, practicing yoga, or writing a book. In fact, I'm going on a solo writers retreat this summer. I've always wanted to write the book, but I'm finally disciplined enough to set a target goal and schedule and stick with it.
